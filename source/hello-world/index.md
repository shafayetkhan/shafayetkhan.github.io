My name is Shafayet (pronounced something like \ ∫hɑ-'fɑ-yεt,h \). I'm a computer programmer working at Layer3 TV in Denver, Colorado. 

My interest is in the core low-level kind of coding as well as high-level stuff. I’m currently learning as much as I can about embedded systems -  I’m on a quest to understand the machine by getting closer to the bare metal, layer by layer.

I'm currently working with C/C++, node.js, and a bit of lisp!

I try to write about things that I’ve learned along the way, hoping that it adds value to others.
